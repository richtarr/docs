You will need to provide the following:

**A hosting server**

Digital Ocean is recommended. This usually costs around $5-10 a month.

**A domain name**

You can use a subdomain of a domain that you already own (e.g. if you own mycompany.co.uk, you can use timetracking.mycompany.co.uk), or you can register a new domain. This usually costs around $10-20 a year.

**A tablet device**

You will need a tablet device to run the app. This can be an iPad, Android tablet, or any other device that can run a web browser. You can also use a laptop or desktop computer, but a tablet is recommended for ease of use. Volunteers can also access the time-tracker on their phones.
